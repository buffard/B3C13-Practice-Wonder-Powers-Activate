// The learning objective of this exercise is writing event listeners to handle button clicks, and modifying the classList of DOM elements when those events are broadcast by the browser.
// 1. Add the correct string as the first argument to addEventListener()
// 2. Write a function named flightHandlerFunction that will remove the disabled class on the corresponding <section id="flight"> (section, not button) and replace it with a class of enabled.

let flight = document.querySelector("#flight")


document.querySelector("#activate-flight").addEventListener("click", )

let flightHandlerFunction = () => {

}
